Still a WIP, working on developer notes to make life easier for developers carrying on and expanding AVOS

Method Prefixes:
	
	add			Add to a dataset
	loadNew		Probably the same as create below... Lets remove.
	create		For adding dynamic javascript elements, graphs etc. 
				These should take an argument for where to place the item (jQuery ID)
